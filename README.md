# Covid-19 Supply Network

The Covid-19 Supply Network is an all-inclusive webapp that connects volunteers to their local community. Users can make requests or offers for healthcare supplies, simply and efficiently at every step of the process.  We aim to make it easy to keep *your* community healthy.

Written as a React app with a Flask app backend.
